This is here temporarily.

I'm building a series of scripts that will aid my work in the company, but I won't be able to post them online.
There are rules against that in the company.

But this is a rough sketch:

Create crontab when certain conditions are met.
Add notify_send so that a pop up comes up.
Now we cna jump into the machine. We can also open it automatically, or after agreeing with it.
