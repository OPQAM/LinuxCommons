The Suite is to be a series of scripts that I'll want to run everytime I create a new system (say, a new Linux VM).
These are utilities, and QoL stuff that I'll (nearly) always want to run.

The idea is to have a main menu that will let me pick and choose which scripts I'll want to run, and those I won't.
One main script will run and call/execute all other scripts. Ideally this will be compiled into a single executable(?)
