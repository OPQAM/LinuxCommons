The Suite is to be a series of scripts that I'll want to run everytime I create a new system (say, a new Linux VM).
These are utilities, and QoL stuff that I'll (nearly) always want to run.

The idea is to have a main menu that will let me pick and choose which scripts I'll want to run, and those I won't.
One main script will run and call/execute all other scripts. Ideally this will be compiled into a single executable(?)

- The dotfiler is running into issues. Check to see what happens when the folder dotfiles hasn't been created yet.
  Apparently the program stops as it warns that there is no git.
