- I've just finished my last version of my calculator

- I had no idea, but *bc* (basic calculator), on which my program depends,
isn't automatically installed into all distros

- Therefore, I decided to add a few lines at the beginning of the program,
to check if *bc* is present in the system. If it isn't, the user is asked
if they want to install the program.
