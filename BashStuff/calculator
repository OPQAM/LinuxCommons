# NOTES:
#
# (1) I had to send the output of 'command' to /dev/null, or it would be
#     outputed onto the terminal
#
# (2) Our while loop. The calculator will run until the user wants it to stop
#
# (3) This is Bash's extended test command ('[ ]' is the simple test version)
#     It's used for conditional expressions
#     '=~' is used for pattern matching. Allows to check if a string matches
#     a RegEx
#     '^[0-9]+$' Starting with a number and adding one or more of the
#     receding. Ends at '$'.
#	  '-?' is an optional minus sign, to allow for negative values
#
# (4) Using case, to make sure that our operation is in the specified set
#
# (5) We can't have a division by zero. This is just a control
#
# (6) The operation had to include 'bc' here, in order to appropriately
#     deal with negatives. It also solves the 'division problem'. We now
#     divide, instead of just 'floor'.
#     'bc' = 'basic calculator'
