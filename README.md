I'm keeping and maintaining this repo, and others, mostly for myself, in order to keep my files safe(r), have them available at all times, and keep some sort of version control on them, for later use.

Since this is Repo 1, I'll be adding here an index of sorts:

- **LinuxCommons** is this very repository, where I keep all things related to Linux. From Bash scripting to automation and tools.

- **MigratingCoconuts** keeps all things Python related. As with the Commons repository, it's all still very bare bones and in need of organization.

- **Pocket-Lab** I'll be keeping in here Network-related stuff. I'm studying for the CCNA cert, and it might not be a bad idea to have some stuff in here. Unfortunately this is the repo that has been getting the least attention.

- **edoC** All things C! And maybe C++ in the future. I've been learning this language, and have had some very basic contact with C++. Need to add a small project I did for uni. But I think I'll devote most of my time to Bash+Linux and Python next. There's not enough time in a working day.

- **Documentation** is a place where all my .txt and .md files can be kept. The idea is to keep interesting ideas, small configurations and setups here. Some might be sent to thei respective repos, but others will be sent here. This should work in tandem with the Wiki + LinkedIn + Blog.


A lot of work will go into this.
