I've created this Git repository in order to keep my Linux files up to date and always ready to be used accross platforms, computers, locations.

Unfortunately, there have been a few security issues and other schenanigans happening, so we've had our Desktops erased time and time again, and this includes all files that aren't inside our own disks.

Also, using git will make it much easier and quicker to update stuff.

I'll be adding other repositories for different subjects - most will likely be private.

Note to self: change this readme file so that it plays nice.
